# UK Rail Environmental Impact Visualisation (IJC445)

This repository contains the R code and composite visualisation developed for the IJC437 Data Visualisation coursework.

## Project Overview
The project investigates how the environmental impact of the UK passenger rail system varies across operators and over time. It focuses on:
- Normalised passenger CO₂e emissions by operator (ORR Table 6103)
- Passenger rail energy consumption and total CO₂e emissions (ORR Table 6105)

The visualisations explore variation, distribution, and comparative intensity across operators and financial years.

## Files in this repository
- `rail_emissions_visualisation.R` – R script used to clean, transform, and visualise the data
- `figure1_composite_visualisation.png` – Composite visualisation (Figure 1) used in the coursework report

## Data Source

## Notes
This repository supports reproducibility and transparency. Raw datasets are not included and should be downloaded directly from the ORR data portal (Tables 6103 and 6105).
